# Character-Counter
Counting Characters!

## What I learned

- DOM Manipulation: How to access and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript methods like getElementById() and innerText.
- Event Handling: Used addEventListener() to trigger actions (like updating the character count) based on user input.
- Real-time Updates: Implemented dynamic updates to the webpage, providing instant feedback to the user as they typed.
